📌 TrafficTelligence: Advanced Traffic Volume Estimation with Machine Learning
🚀 Description:
TrafficTelligence is a machine learning-based project designed to estimate traffic volume using real-world data. The model analyzes traffic patterns and predicts vehicle density based on various factors like time of day and environmental conditions.

🔹 Features:

Uses pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data processing and visualization.
Implements a Linear Regression Model for traffic prediction.
Includes a Flask-based API to serve predictions.
🛠 Setup Instructions:
1️⃣ Clone the repository:
'''bash
git clone https://github.com/TechNik2006/Traffic-ML-Project.git
2️⃣ Install dependencies:
'''bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the project:
'''bash
python traffic_ml_project.py

4️⃣ Start the Flask API:
'''bash
flask --app traffic_ml_project run
📊 Model Performance:

Mean Absolute Error: ~109.81
R² Score: ~-0.08
